## 🧪 Basic AI Try-On Flow (Demo Version)

1. Detect pose using MediaPipe or OpenPose
2. Extract coordinates for shoulders, waist
3. Use OpenCV to resize and overlay clothing image
4. Output final try-on preview

For realistic generation, use ControlNet + Stable Diffusion with a body-pose-conditioned image-to-image pipeline.
